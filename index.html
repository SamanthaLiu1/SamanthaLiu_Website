        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Samantha. I am a current student residing in the Aberdeen Inverness Residence Halls at the University of California:Riverside.
        The major that I am going into is the Biochemistry major and I am also in CNAS. Right now, the school quarter has gone by quick and it has already been past 5 weeks.
        I'm not having too much difficulty in my classes although, memorization has always been a huge roadblock of mine. I find it difficult to remember the information in subjects
        unless I have learned about it over and over again for at least a year. I used to be a fast learner, or at least that is what my parents have told me. They spoke of me
        being able to remember many Chinese poems and songs when I was just a toddler. Now my mind feels like cogs constantly chugging and rusting up.<br><br>

        Through these weeks I have learned much about computers, math, and chemistry. I still have to pick my class for winter quarter though some midterms are happening as well.
        It is a bit difficult to find time as I also need breaks in between working intervals. Rest is always needed otherwise the brain can not function. Many of my friend who have not
        had enough sleep tend to have headaches or that their eyes feel like they are burning. Though some causes of this can be time management, there may be other underlying
        health issues that increase these symptoms. I lessen the risk of these symptoms by turning on nightlight mode on my computer as well as my lamp.<br><br>

        My parents have been calling me at least 1 time each week. Though I do feel that it is a bit irritating since I would rather call them if I needed help from them, I get that they are worried about me. 
        However, I know that some day, I can't depend on them and I feel like calling them makes me depend on them too much. I do also sometimes call my friends who are online friends. I find it hard to socialize with other people in person as I am not
        sure if they have the same interests I do. It is much easier to find people who have the same interests as you online. All you need to do is search your interest and click. This is also mainly because
        I feel like I will be judged for my interests from the get go if I immediately try to find in person friends. I feel like there would be constant staring if I show what I like too much.
        However, you can immediately find people who will socialize with you online and like the same interests with you as well. And eventually, if you meet those people in person, it would be less
        uncomfortable. I know trusting online people is not a very good way to make in person friends because of certain people like predators, however, this is the only way that I am comfortable with
        although my parents also disagree with this method.
